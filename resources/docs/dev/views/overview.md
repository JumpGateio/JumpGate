## Overview

The JumpGate View Resolution package brings back a feature from Laravel 3.  Based on your route and your controller, it 
attempts to automatically figure out what blade file or vue component you are trying to view.  If it can, it sends you to 
it without you having to define it at all.  It also comes with a debugbar collector to show you where it attempted to find 
the file.
