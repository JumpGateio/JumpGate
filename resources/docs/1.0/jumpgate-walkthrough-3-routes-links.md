## Introduction

In this step of creating our todo app, we are going to continue building out the todo service.  In this step we will be 
setting up our routes and navigation links.  The routes all live in the `app/Services/ToDo/Http/Routes` directory.

# Routes

In JumpGate, we use class based routing.  By this we mean that we do not use the default `routes/web.php` file to store 
routes.  Even using includes and sub directories to keep this organized more, it still felt odd to us.  So we created a 
system where we could use a PHP class as a route group.  To assist with this we have created a base route class and an 
interface.  These are pretty easy once you get used to them.

All you need to get a route class started is the namespace, the middleware and the routes method.  Create a new file named 
`TaskList.php` in `app/Services/ToDo/Http/Routes`.  We will add the following needed code to get started.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Services\ToDo\Http\Routes;

use Illuminate\Routing\Router;
use JumpGate\Core\Contracts\Routes;
use JumpGate\Core\Http\Routes\BaseRoute;

class TaskList extends BaseRoute implements Routes
{
    public $namespace = 'App\Services\Http\Controllers';
    
    public $middleware = [
        'web',
        'auth',
    ];

    public function routes(Router $router)
    {
        //
    }
}
```

This all behaves exactly like you are used to, just in a class instead of a flat file.  The `namespace` is used to tell Laravel 
where our controllers will be located.  The `middleware` is what middleware should be run before allowing access to these 
routes.  The `routes()` method itself is where we place our routes that the user can access.  Let's add our routes that 
we know we will need.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Services\ToDo\Http\Routes;

use Illuminate\Routing\Router;
use JumpGate\Core\Contracts\Routes;
use JumpGate\Core\Http\Routes\BaseRoute;

class TaskList extends BaseRoute implements Routes
{
    public $namespace = 'App\Services\Http\Controllers';

    public $middleware = [
        'web',
        'auth',
    ];

    public function routes(Router $router)
    {
        $router->get('create')
            ->name('task-list.create')
            ->uses('TaskList@create')
            ->middleware('active:task-list.create');
        $router->post('create')
            ->name('task-list.create')
            ->uses('TaskList@store');

        $router->get('edit/{id}')
            ->name('task-list.edit')
            ->uses('TaskList@edit')
            ->middleware('active:task-list.edit');
        $router->post('edit/{id}')
            ->name('task-list.edit')
            ->uses('TaskList@update');

        $router->get('delete/{id}')
            ->name('task-list.delete')
            ->uses('TaskList@delete');

        $router->get('{id}')
            ->name('task-list.show')
            ->uses('TaskList@show')
            ->middleware('active:task-list');

        $router->get('/')
            ->name('task-list.index')
            ->uses('TaskList@index')
            ->middleware('active:task-list.index');
    }
}
```

As you can see, once inside the `routes()` method, everything behaves the same way it does in the Laravel route file.  The 
one thing that may be new is the `active:task-list` middleware.  This is part of our `Menu` package and is used to add the 
active class to your links when a user is on that route.  The view part is already handled by our menu views so you don't 
need to do any extra work to make it happen.

You should notice that any route that will be dealing directly with an individual task list has `{id}` on it.  This is 
how we define a wildcard URL parameter in Laravel.

> {primary} A bit of magic happens here.  You don't have to define your route classes anywhere.  The `app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php` 
class uses it's load method to automatically find your route classes.

# Links

Let's add the links.  To do this open `app/Http/Composers/Menu.php` and go to the `generateLeftMenu()` method.  We are going 
to add our new links here.

```php
/**
 * Adds items to the menu that appears on the left side of the main menu.
 */
private function generateLeftMenu()
{
    $leftMenu = \Menu::getMenu('leftMenu');

    $leftMenu->link('docs', function (Link $link) {
        $link->name = 'Documentation';
        $link->url  = route('larecipe.index');
    });

    $leftMenu->dropDown('task-list', 'Lists', function (DropDown $dropDown) {
        $dropDown->link('task-list.index', function (Link $link) {
            $link->name = 'All Lists';
            $link->url  = route('task-list.index');
        });
        $dropDown->link('task-list.create', function (Link $link) {
            $link->name = 'Create List';
            $link->url  = route('task-list.create');
        });
    });
}
```

This is how we add links to the menu in JumpGate.  You can see at the start we set up the menu object.  Calling `getMenu()` 
will either create a new menu with that name or find an existing one.  Next is the `docs` link that comes by default with 
JumpGate.  To make a single link in the menu you call the `link()` method on your menu object.  It requires a `name` and 
a `url` to work.  The `name` is used as the text for the link when displaying it and the `url` is used for where to send 
the user when they click on it.  Moving on, you will see our drop down for task lists.  The method `dropDown()` will create 
a drop down on a menu object.  This behaves almost like a miniature menu object since it can have links applied to it.  There 
is one main difference though.  When you use the `active` middleware, as we said earlier, is used to turn a link 
active in the view.  However, if that link is part of a drop down, the drop down itself is active as well.  This is the 
behavior we want as it allows the user to know where they are in the navigation without much effort or confusion.  Inside 
the drop down we created links to 2 of our 7 routes: index and create.  The other 5 are not really linkable since they 
require the `id` of a task list to do anything with.

Now do the same thing for our Tasks.  Create a `Task.php` in `app/Services/ToDo/Http/Routes`.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Services\ToDo\Http\Routes;

use Illuminate\Routing\Router;
use JumpGate\Core\Contracts\Routes;
use JumpGate\Core\Http\Routes\BaseRoute;

class Task extends BaseRoute implements Routes
{
    public $namespace = 'App\Services\ToDo\Http\Controllers';

    public $prefix = 'task';

    public $middleware = [
        'web',
        'auth',
    ];

    public function routes(Router $router)
    {
        $router->get('create/{listId}')
            ->name('task.create')
            ->uses('Task@create')
            ->middleware('active:task.create');
        $router->post('create/{listId}')
            ->name('task.create')
            ->uses('Task@store');

        $router->get('edit/{id}')
            ->name('task.edit')
            ->uses('Task@edit')
            ->middleware('active:task.edit');
        $router->post('edit/{id}')
            ->name('task.edit')
            ->uses('Task@update');

        $router->get('delete/{id}')
            ->name('task.delete')
            ->uses('Task@delete');

        $router->get('{id}')
            ->name('task.show')
            ->uses('Task@show')
            ->middleware('active:task');
    }
}
```

This file is nearly identical but we replaced `task-list` with `task` for our route names and active middleware.  We also 
changed the controller from `TaskList` to `Task`.  Lastly, we removed the `index` route since you can view all tasks in a 
list using `task-list.show`.
