# Overview

---

JumpGate is meant to be a quick boilerplate for spinning up a Laravel application.  It is designed to be very quick to set up,
very easy to use, and most importantly, stay out of your way.  By that we mean that we offer lots of helpers and tools, and 
exactly zero of them are required for you to use.  Use what you want, ignore what you don't.

Currently we ship with the following packages/versions by default.
